## Backend API Assessment

As part of our assessment process, we need you to make a backend API server application using Spring Boot.

### Objective:

You are going to implement a backend API using Spring Boot to store customer transactions and generate reports. Since this is for backend API, no user interface is required. The backend should be operable with REST API alone. The API will be used by company staff, as users, to add transactions on behalf of customers. We need you to complete this assessment within 3 days.

### User:

1.  API to perform CRUD operations on user data. Users have one or more roles. At minimum, implement 2 roles, **admin** and **user**. Admin can do anything. Users can modify their own profile, create new transactions, and generate reports.
2.  Customer can login and update his/her own profile.
3.  Customer can download his/her transactions report.
4.  Customer can only see his/her transactions in report.
